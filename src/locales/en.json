    "whoami": "I'm studying ICT engineering at Oulu University of Applied Sciences, with a focus on software development and cloud tech. Before I got into IT, I spent over five years doing industrial work - welding and winding transformers and inductors. That background taught me the value of getting things right the first time and building things that actually work. I bring that same approach to my projects now.",
    "whatidoTitle": "What I Do \uD83D\uDCAD",
    "whatido": "I build web apps and backend systems that don't need constant fixing. I'm drawn to self-hosted services and automation - the kind of stuff that runs quietly in the background and just works. If I can automate something or run it on my own hardware, I probably will. Coffee helps with this process.\n\nI also mess around with electronics. Soldering, wiring, programming ESP32s and Raspberry Pis. I like the challenge of connecting hardware and software into actually useful.",
    "whatido_sub": "Right now I'm looking for an internship, thesis position, or junior role where I can use these skills in a real environment and keep learning.",
