    "whoami": "I study ICT engineering at Oulu University of Applied Sciences, focusing on software development and cloud technologies. Before getting into IT, I spent over five years in industrial work - welding and winding transformers and inductors. That time taught me to value clear structure, efficiency, and doing things properly the first time. I still carry the same mindset into everything I build today, whether it’s a personal project, school assignment or work-related.",
    "whatidoTitle": "What I Do \uD83D\uDCAD",
    "whatido": "I build web apps and backend systems that stay stable without constant babysitting. I focus on self-hosted services and automation workflows that run quietly in the background. If something can be automated or run on my own hardware, I’m usually already doing it. Coffee may or may not be involved. (It is.). I also tinker with electronics - soldering, wiring and programming microcontrollers like ESP32s and Raspberry Pis. I like connecting the hardware and software into something useful.",
